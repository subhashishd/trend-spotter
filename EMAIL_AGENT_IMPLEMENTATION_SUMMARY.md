4. **📧 NEW: Email delivery** - Automatically send formatted report to configured recipients
5. **Confirmation** - Provide delivery status to user

## 🔧 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Configure Email Credentials

You need to set up Gmail app-specific password and environment variables:

#### A. Gmail Setup
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security → 2-Step Verification (enable if not already)
3. Go to Security → App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail" → "Other (Trend Spotter)"
5. Copy the 16-character password

#### B. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Option 1: Export temporarily (for testing)
export SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
export SENDER_APP_PASSWORD="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"

# Option 2: Add to your ~/.zshrc (permanent)
echo 'export SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SENDER_APP_PASSWORD="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Test Email Functionality
```bash
cd /Users/subhashishdas/trend_spotter
python test_email_agent.py
```

Expected output if successful:
```
🧪 Email Agent Test Suite
========================================
🔍 Checking email configuration...
✅ SENDER_EMAIL: your-email@gmail.com
✅ SENDER_APP_PASSWORD: **************** (hidden)

📧 Testing email agent...
📧 Preparing to send email to <your email address>...
📤 Connecting to SMTP server smtp.gmail.com:587...
📤 Email agent response: ✅ Email successfully sent to <your email address> at 2024-12-17 10:30:45 UTC

✅ All email tests passed!
📧 Check <your email address> for the test email.
```

### Step 3: Test Full Workflow
Once email is configured, test the complete system:

```bash
# Start the web interface
./start_web.sh

# Or use command line
adk run .
```

Then ask: "What are the latest AI agent trends?"

The system should:
1. Research trends from Google and Reddit
2. Generate a comprehensive report
3. Automatically send the report to configured recipients
4. Confirm delivery

## 📧 Email Features

- **Header**: Gradient background with report metadata
- **Content**: Clean white background with structured sections
- **Styling**: Professional fonts, colors, and layout
- **Responsive**: Works well on desktop and mobile email clients
- **Links**: Clickable source URLs
- **Footer**: Generation timestamp and system attribution

### MCP Compliance
- **Tool-based architecture**: Email functionality exposed as a proper tool
- **Structured parameters**: Clear parameter definitions with types
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with detailed error messages
- **Stateless operation**: Each email operation is independent
- **JSON-compatible responses**: Structured success/error responses

### Security
- **App-specific passwords**: Uses Gmail app passwords, not main password
- **TLS encryption**: All email communication encrypted
- **Environment variables**: Credentials stored securely outside code

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Customization Options
You can customize the email agent by modifying:

1. **Recipient**: Must be configured via EMAIL_RECIPIENTS environment variable or GitHub secrets
2. **SMTP Settings**: Environment variables for different email providers
3. **HTML Template**: Modify `_format_report_as_html()` function
4. **Subject Format**: Update in `EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT`

### Multiple Recipients
To add multiple recipients, you could extend the function to accept a list:

```python
# Example enhancement (not implemented yet)
def send_email_report(
    recipient_emails: list[str],  # Multiple recipients
    subject: str,
    report_content: str,
    report_date_range: str = "N/A"
) -> str:
    # Implementation would loop through recipients
```

### Email Templates
The system includes a sophisticated HTML template with:
- CSS styling for professional appearance
- Emoji support for visual appeal
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Proper email client compatibility

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Email credentials not configured"**
   - Run: `echo $SENDER_EMAIL` to check if set
   - Follow Step 1 above to configure

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Verify 2FA is enabled on Google account
   - Generate a new app password
   - Double-check the 16-character password

3. **"Connection refused"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Some corporate networks block SMTP
   - Try different network (mobile hotspot)

4. **Import errors**
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory
   - Activate virtual environment: `source myenv/bin/activate`
   - Reinstall if needed: `pip install -e .`

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test email configuration
python test_email_agent.py

# Test agent loading
python -c "from trend_spotter.sub_agents.email_agent import email_agent; print('OK')"

# Test main agent with email
python -c "from trend_spotter import root_agent; print('OK')"

# Check environment variables
echo "Email: $SENDER_EMAIL"
echo "Password set: $([ -n "$SENDER_APP_PASSWORD" ] && echo 'Yes' || echo 'No')"
```

## 📋 Next Steps After Email Setup

1. **Test the email functionality** with `test_email_agent.py`
2. **Run a full trend analysis** to see the complete workflow
3. **Check your email** at your configured address for the beautifully formatted report
4. **Optional**: Customize email templates or add additional recipients
5. **Optional**: Deploy to Google Cloud Run to have automated email reports

## 🎯 Summary

You now have a **complete 3-agent system**:
1. **Google Search Agent** - Finds recent news and articles
2. **Reddit Agent** - Discovers developer conversations
3. **📧 Email Agent** - Delivers professional HTML reports via email

The system uses **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** standards for the email functionality, ensuring compatibility with modern AI agent architectures.

**The only thing needed now is email configuration** - once you set up the Gmail app password and environment variables, the system will automatically email you professional trend reports!
